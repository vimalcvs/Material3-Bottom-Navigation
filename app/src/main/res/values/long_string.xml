  <string name="old_and_wise">Old and Wise\n\n\n\n
        by The Alan Parsons Project\n\n\n\n
        As far as my eyes can see\n\n
There are Shadows approaching me\n\n
And to those I left behind\n\n
I wanted you to Know\n\n
You\'ve always shared my deepest thoughts\n\n
You follow where I go\n\n
And oh when I\'m old and wise\n\n
Bitter words mean little to me\n\n
Autumn Winds will blow right through me\n\n
And someday in the mist of time\n\n
When they asked me if I knew you\n\n
I\'d smile and say you were a friend of mine\n\n
And the sadness would be Lifted from my eyes\n\n
Oh when I\'m old and wise\n\n
As far as my Eyes can see\n\n
There are shadows surrounding me\n\n
And to those I leave behind\n\n
I want you all to know\n\n
You\'ve always Shared my darkest hours\n\n
I\'ll miss you when I go\n\n
And oh, when I\'m old and wise\n\n
Heavy words that tossed and blew me\n\n
Like Autumn winds that will blow right through me\n\n
And someday in the mist of time\n\n
When they ask you if you knew me\n\n
Remember that You were a friend of mine\n\n
As the final curtain falls before my eyes\n\n
Oh when I\'m Old and wise\n\n
As far as my eyes can see\n\n</string>
